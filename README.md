# IoT_Final_Project: Surveillance Car controlled with website
The orginal idea was to design a car that could be controlled without raspberry pi itself. In real life, this can be used when encountered serious traffic; the officer could move the car from their interface, and guide the traffic. For future adaptation, we can train our car and recognize specific gestures so that the traffic police could control the car with its gestures.
